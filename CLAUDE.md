## Project Overview

DeepFamily is a blockchain-based decentralized global digital family tree protocol leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, NFTs, ERC20 token economics, and community governance to create a collaborative, verifiable, and perpetual family history recording system.

## Two-Layer Value System

The system implements a two-layer value model that balances privacy protection with community validation:

### Layer 1: Privacy Protection (Hash Storage)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Uses Groth16 proofs to add family tree members privately
- **Salted Passphrase Unlinkability**: Uses cryptographic hash combinations with unique passphrases to prevent identity inference
- **Anti-Pollution Protection**: Unique passphrases prevent malicious users from creating fake versions pointing to real people
- **Dual Tree Models**: Supports both public collaborative trees (shared passphrase) and private protected trees (unique passphrase)
- **Family Tree Networks**: Build relationships through personHash/fatherHash/motherHash connections
- **Token Incentives**: Receive DEEP tokens only when both parent relationships exist (complete family data)

### Layer 2: Value Confirmation (NFT Assets)
- **Public Disclosure**: Community-endorsed versions can be minted as NFTs, revealing full personal information
- **Story Sharding**: Detailed biographical data stored in up to 100×1KB on-chain chunks
- **Community Validation**: Must endorse a version before minting its NFT
- **Value Recognition**: NFTs represent community-validated family tree data

### Key Advantages
- **Progressive Privacy Model**: Private submission → Community endorsement → Optional public disclosure
- **Smart Incentives**: Tokens reward complete family data, NFTs reward quality information
- **Risk Management**: Private layer allows exploration, public layer ensures quality
- **Value Discovery**: Natural evolution from private data to community-validated assets

## Smart Contract Architecture

### DeepFamily.sol - Main Protocol
- Multi-version person data with ZK proof validation
- Community endorsement system with automatic fee distribution
- NFT minting with on-chain biographical storage
- Story sharding system for detailed life narratives
- Mining rewards for complete family connections
- Comprehensive security with 50+ custom errors

### DeepFamilyToken.sol - DEEP Token
- ERC20 with progressive halving mining mechanism
- 100 billion supply cap with 10 halving cycles
- Expanding cycle lengths: 1→10→100→1K→10K→100K→1M→10M→100M→Fixed 100M
- Authorized minting only by DeepFamily contract

### ZK Verifier Contracts
- **PersonHashVerifier**: Validates family relationships for private submissions
- **NamePoseidonVerifier**: Proves name ownership for NFT minting
- Both use Groth16 proofs with circom circuits

## Key Features

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy System
- **Private Family Tree Construction**: Add members without revealing personal information
- **Salted Passphrase Unlinkability**: Prevents identity inference and pollution attacks through unique passphrases
- **Dual Tree Architecture**: Public collaborative trees vs. private protected trees for relationship correctness
- **Selective Disclosure**: Users choose when to reveal information through NFT minting
- **Dual-Hash Design**: Poseidon commitments + keccak256 wrapping for security
- **Limb-Based Verification**: Efficient on-chain ZK proof validation

### Economic Incentives
- **Smart Mining**: Rewards only for complete family data (both parents exist)
- **Community Endorsement**: Pay current mining reward to endorse trusted versions
- **Fee Distribution**: Majority flows to NFT holders or contributors, with a small protocol share (default 5%, max 20%) for sustainability
- **Progressive Halving**: Advanced tokenomics with 10 halving cycles

### Data Management
- **Multi-Version System**: Each person supports multiple data versions with duplicate prevention
- **Family Relationships**: Complete parent-child relationship tracking with version references
- **Story Sharding**: Biographical data in sequentially indexed, hash-verified chunks
- **Immutable Sealing**: Stories can be permanently locked for historical preservation

### Scalability & Security
- **Paginated Queries**: Gas-optimized queries with 100-record limits
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Comprehensive security against attacks
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with explicit error handling
- **ETH Rejection**: Contract rejects direct ETH transfers
